## 2. Service-by-Service Migration Comparison

| AWS Service                    | GCP Equivalent                                            | Migration Complexity | Adaptation Strategy                                                                                                                                 |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS Lambda + LWA (FastAPI)** | **Cloud Run**                                             | **Low**              | Packaged as a standard container. Deploy directly to Cloud Run. Remove `AWS Lambda Web Adapter` layer; Cloud Run handles native HTTP routing.       |
| **AWS Lambda Function URL**    | **Cloud Run Service URL**                                 | **Low**              | Expose Cloud Run directly via public URL. Cloud Run natively supports HTTP Response Streaming (Server-Sent Events) without proxy gateway buffering. |
| **Clerk Authentication**       | **Identity Platform** _(Firebase Auth)_ or keep **Clerk** | **Low**              | Keep Clerk since it is cloud-agnostic, or swap for Firebase Auth SDK. Backend fetches JWKS from the provider to verify JWT signatures offline.      |
| **Amazon DynamoDB**            | **Cloud Firestore** _(Datastore or Native)_               | **Medium**           | Recreate Single-Table design inside Firestore documents. Map keys using indexes and nested structures. Firestore supports `TTL` (Time To Live).     |
| **Amazon S3 (Uploads)**        | **Cloud Storage (GCS)**                                   | **Low**              | Swap S3 client operations to Google Cloud Storage Python client. Map S3 Presigned URLs to GCS Signed URLs.                                          |
| **Amazon S3 (Frontend Site)**  | **Firebase Hosting**                                      | **Low**              | Best target. Firebase Hosting serves React/Vite outputs, handles SSL, CDN, custom domains, and rewrites all requests to `index.html` for SPAs.      |
| **Amazon S3 Vectors**          | **Firestore Vector Search**                               | **Medium**           | Firestore natively supports Vector Indexing and Vector Similarity queries (`VectorDistance`). No external vector client needed.                     |
| **Amazon SQS + DLQ**           | **Cloud Pub/Sub**                                         | **Low**              | Create a Pub/Sub topic and use a **Push Subscription** to directly trigger the worker. Pub/Sub natively supports Dead Letter Topics.                |
| **AWS Lambda Worker**          | **Cloud Functions (2nd Gen)**                             | **Low**              | Port background worker to a 2nd Gen Cloud Function. Cloud Functions 2nd Gen run natively on top of Cloud Run infrastructure.                        |
| **AWS Textract**               | **Document AI (OCR)**                                     | **Low**              | Use Google's Document AI OCR processor. Document AI excels at layout detection and returns clean structural layouts.                                |
| **SSM Parameter Store**        | **Secret Manager**                                        | **Low**              | Store secret keys as Secret Manager secrets. Inject them directly into Cloud Run/Functions environments via IAM bindings.                           |
| **CloudWatch Logs**            | **Cloud Logging**                                         | **Low**              | `stdout` print statements and logging modules automatically feed into Google Cloud's Operations Suite (Stackdriver).                                |

## 3. Financial Matrix: Free Tiers vs. Paid Credits

GCP has some of the most generous and well-known serverless free tiers in the industry.

### 🟢 100% Free / Always Free Tiers

These services cost **$0.00** forever under moderate development use.

- **Identity Platform (Firebase Auth):**
  - _Grant:_ **50,000 Monthly Active Users (MAUs)** completely free for standard email/password accounts.
  - _Role:_ User sign-up and login directory.
- **Cloud Run:**
  - _Grant:_ **2 million requests**, 180,000 vCPU-seconds, and 360,000 GiB-seconds free _every single month_.
  - _Role:_ FastAPI Backend compute. If set to scale-to-zero, idle time is 100% free.
- **Cloud Functions (2nd Gen):**
  - _Grant:_ **2 million invocations** free monthly, along with additional compute seconds covered under the standard Cloud Run free allocation.
  - _Role:_ Ingestion background worker.

  - _Role:_ Request logging, trace outputs, and diagnostics.

### 🟡 Eligible for Free Tier (Limited/Temporary)

- **Document AI (OCR / Layout Analysis):**
  - _Grant:_ First **1,000 pages free per month** for standard Document OCR.
  - _After Limit:_ Standard OCR is **$1.50 per 1,000 pages** (Layout analysis is $15 per 1,000 pages).
  - _Role:_ Structural layout parsing for PDF documents.

### 🔴 Requires Credits / Paid Services

- **LLM Endpoints (via LiteLLM / Gemini):**
  - _Pricing Model:_ API tokens generated through Gemini/LiteLLM NIM endpoints are billed directly by their API providers, not GCP (unless using Vertex AI Model Garden endpoints).

## 4. GCP Cost Traps & Mitigation Strategies

Avoid these silent cost triggers on Google Cloud to ensure your deployment remains completely free:

### Trap #1: Leaving Cloud Run "Minimum Instances = 1"

- **The Danger:** Cloud Run has a "Min Instances" slider to mitigate cold starts. If `min-instances` is set to `1`, Google keeps your container warm 24/7. This consumes your free monthly vCPU/GiB allocations within days, leading to continuous billing.
- **The Mitigation:** Set `min-instances: 0` and `max-instances: 5` (or low limits). Embrace the minor cold-start latency to preserve your free tier.

### Trap #2: Storing GCS Blobs outside standard Regional Buckets

- **The Danger:** The GCS 5 GB free tier is strictly limited to specific US-regions (`us-east1`, `us-west1`, `us-central1`) using standard regional storage. Choosing multi-regional storage or placing your bucket in a European/Asian region will trigger billing immediately.
- **The Mitigation:** Always deploy GCS buckets inside one of the three free US regions and stick to **Standard Storage**. Set up an **Object Lifecycle Management Rule** to automatically delete uploads after 7 days.

### Trap #3: Exceeding daily Firestore write allowances with indexing loops

- **The Danger:** While Firestore gives you 20,000 free writes per day, a buggy vector ingestion loop or continuous batch upsert tests on large books can exceed this daily limit within minutes, triggering database charges.
- **The Mitigation:** Add chunk limits in your ingestion worker to prevent indexing multi-thousand-page documents during testing phases.

## 5. IaC & Local Development

To manage IaC, building, and local environments on GCP, you swap AWS SAM for:

### A. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform

Unlike AWS SAM which compiles to CloudFormation, GCP’s primary orchestration standard is **HashiCorp Terraform**. Terraform is fully open-source, highly modular, and manages GCP resources natively using declarative syntax.

Here is a snippet of HCL (`main.tf`) matching your AWS stack:

```hcl
# 1. Cloud Storage Bucket (S3 replacement)
resource "google_storage_bucket" "uploads" {
  name          = "chatbot-uploads-prod"
  location      = "US-CENTRAL1" # Eligible for GCS Free Tier
  storage_class = "STANDARD"

  lifecycle_rule {
    action { type = "Delete" }
    condition { age = 7 } // Auto-clean files after 7 days
  }
}

# 2. Cloud Run Service (Lambda + LWA replacement)
resource "google_cloud_run_service" "backend" {
  name     = "chatbot-backend"
  location = "us-central1"

  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = "gcr.io/my-project/chatbot-backend:latest"
        resources {
          limits = { cpu = "1000m", memory = "1024Mi" }
        }
      }
    }
    metadata {
      annotations = {
        "autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale" = "0" // Critical for $0/month scale-to-zero
        "autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale" = "5"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### B. Deployment CLI: The Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`)

The equivalent to the `sam deploy` workflow is the **`gcloud` CLI**.

- Build your containers locally or via **Cloud Build** (`gcloud builds submit`).
- Deploy containerized code directly using simple commands:

  ```bash
  gcloud run deploy chatbot-backend --image gcr.io/my-project/chatbot-backend:latest --platform managed
  ```

### C. Local Testing Emulators: Firebase Emulator Suite

GCP offers one of the most cohesive local emulation environments in the industry: the **Firebase Emulator Suite**.

- Run `firebase emulators:start` to boot up **local, offline emulators** for:
  - **Firestore** (including vector index simulations).
  - **Firebase Hosting** (hosting local React/Vite configurations).
  - **Firebase Auth** (testing registration flows on localhost).

---

## 6. Summary Checklist for a Cost-Free Deployment (GCP)

To run the entire migrated stack on GCP for **$0.00/month**:

1. **Frontend:** Deploy React/Vite to **Firebase Hosting** (Free Plan).
2. **Backend Engine:** Host containerized FastAPI on **Cloud Run** (`min-instances: 0`).
3. **Database:** Deploy **Cloud Firestore** in Native Mode, utilizing its always-free daily quota.
4. **Vector Search:** Enable **Firestore Vector Indexing** within your Firestore databases.
5. **Decoupled Queue:** Route bucket triggers via **Cloud Pub/Sub** topics using a **Push Subscription** to target your worker.
6. **Ingestion Compute:** Deploy the worker as a **2nd Gen Cloud Function** (Consumption Plan).
7. **Secrets:** Bind parameters securely to **Google Secret Manager** (up to 6 secrets are free).
8. **Auth Directory:** Enable **Identity Platform** to manage user registers/logins.
9. **Infrastructure Orchestration:** Use **Terraform** and the **`gcloud` CLI** for deployment.
